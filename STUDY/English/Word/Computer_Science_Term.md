**Computer program** : A set of instructions that the computer can perform in order to perform some task.

**Programming** : The process of creating a program.

**Source code** : produced by programmers when they create programs and a list of commands typed into one or more text files.

**Machine code** : The limited set of instruction that a CPU can understand directly.

**Hardware** : The collection of physical computer parts that make up a computer and execute programs

**Running( or executing) the program** : when a computer program is loaded into memory and the hardware sequentially executes each instruction.

Each instruction is composed of a sequence 1s and 0s. Each individual 0 or 1 is called a **binary digit** or **bit** for short. Each set of binary digits is interpreted by the CPU into a command to do a very specific job, such as compare these two numbers, or put this number in that memory location.

**Assembly language** : Instead of machine language that so hard for humans to read and understand, This was invented language that each instruction is identified by a short abbreviation and names and other numbers can be used.

**Assembler** is program that translate the assembly program into machine language before it can be executed by computer.

**Compiler** is program that reads source code and produces a stand-alone executable program that can then be run.

**Interpreter** is a program that directly executes the instructions in the source code without requiring them to be compiled into an executable first.

**Query** is a request for data or information from a datavase table or combination of table. 

**capability** : An operating system security or access control model where specific types of access to a specific object are granted by giving a process this data structure or token.

**Memory footprint** : refers to the amount of main memory that a program uses or references while running
