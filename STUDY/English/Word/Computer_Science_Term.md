**Computer program** : A set of instructions that the computer can perform in order to perform some task.

**Programming** : The process of creating a program.

**Source code** : produced by programmers when they create programs and a list of commands typed into one or more text files.

**Machine code** : The limited set of instruction that a CPU can understand directly.

**Hardware** : The collection of physical computer parts that make up a computer and execute programs

**Running( or executing) the program** : when a computer program is loaded into memory and the hardware sequentially executes each instruction.

Each instruction is composed of a sequence 1s and 0s. Each individual 0 or 1 is called a **binary digit** or **bit** for short. Each set of binary digits is interpreted by the CPU into a command to do a very specific job, such as compare these two numbers, or put this number in that memory location.

**Assembly language** : Instead of machine language that so hard for humans to read and understand, This was invented language that each instruction is identified by a short abbreviation and names and other numbers can be used.

**Assembler** is program that translate the assembly program into machine language before it can be executed by computer.

**Compiler** is program that reads source code and produces a stand-alone executable program that can then be run.

**Interpreter** is a program that directly executes the instructions in the source code without requiring them to be compiled into an executable first.

**Query** is a request for data or information from a datavase table or combination of table. 

**capability** : An operating system security or access control model where specific types of access to a specific object are granted by giving a process this data structure or token.

**Memory footprint** : refers to the amount of main memory that a program uses or references while running

**NUll-terminated string** : a null-terminated string is a character string stored as an array containing the characters and terminated with a null character (a character with a value of zero).

**String Constants** : String constants , alse known as string literals, are a special type of constants which store fixed wequences of charactors. A string literal is a sequence of any number of characters surrounded by double quotes.

**Blob** : a binary large object, a collection of binary data stored as a single entity. Blobs are typically image, audio, or other multimedia objects, though sometimes binary executable code is stored as a blob.

**Overhead** : any combination of excess or indirect computation time, memory, bandwidth, or other resources that are required to perform a specific task. ; 어떤 처리를 하기 위해 들어가는 간접적인 처리시간. 메모리 등을 말한다. 예를 들어 a 라는 처리를 단순하기 실행하는데 10초가 걸린다고 가정할 때  안정성 고려와 B 라는 부가적 처리를 추가 했을 때 15초 걸렸다면 오버헤드는 5초가 된다. 

**Strict subset** : A is a subset of B, but additionally, A is different from B.

**Dummy vertex** :  represented by small circles with grey fills.

**Degenerate** : lacking some property, order, distinctness of structure previously or usually present.

**Attribute** : a chaneable property or characteristic of some component of a program that can be set to different values.

**Invocation** : Each execution of a shader within a Rendering Command

**Validation : checking or verifying any data before it is allowed into a computer system. this process (data validation) helps ensure data was not compromied or corrupted during transmission

textured surface : 

**Refresh Rate** :   the number of times per second that a rster-based display device displays a new image (화면 주사율, 화면 빈도율, 화면 재생률)

**Raster graphics** represents a two-dimensional picture as a rectangular matrx or grid of square pixels.

**Bandwidth** : a measurement of the ability of an electronic communications device or system (such as a computer network) to send and receive information

low frequency : 저주파, 30 ~ 300 kilohertZ

**Coprocessor** : an extra processor in a computer that is designed to perform specialized tasks (such as mathematical calculations)

**Operation** : an action that is carried out to accomplish.

**Fixed statement** : The Fixed statement prevents the garbage collector from relocating a moveable variable and declares a pointer to that variable. The address of a fixed, or pinned, variable doesn't change during execution of the statement.

**Atomic** : Generally, you can summarize atomic as "one at a time". For example, when accessing or mutating a property is atomic, it means that only one read or write operation can be performed at a time. if you have a program that reads a property atomically, this means that the property cannot change during this read operation.

**Gouraud shading** : (computer graphics) A method of sumulating the effects of light colour across the surface of an object, based on estimates of the surface normal of each vertex in a polygonal 3D model.  / 고러드 채식 , 3차원 그래픽에서 화면에 나타난 입체 표면에 색을 적당하게 입혀서 물체에 입체감과 질감을 주는 채색 알고리즘의 하나. 이것은 두 평면이 만나는 곳에서 색이 갑자기 변하는 것을 막기 위해 평면 중심에서 교차선까지 연속적으로 색이 점차로 변하게 된다. 

**Frustum** : 기하학에서 절두체는 입체(보통 원뿔이나 각뿔)를 절단하는 하나나 두 평행면 사이의 부분이다.
