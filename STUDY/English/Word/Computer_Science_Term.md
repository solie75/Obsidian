**Computer program** : A set of instructions that the computer can perform in order to perform some task.

**Programming** : The process of creating a program.

**Source code** : produced by programmers when they create programs and a list of commands typed into one or more text files.

**Machine code** : The limited set of instruction that a CPU can understand directly.

**Hardware** : The collection of physical computer parts that make up a computer and execute programs

**Running( or executing) the program** : when a computer program is loaded into memory and the hardware sequentially executes each instruction.

Each instruction is composed of a sequence 1s and 0s. Each individual 0 or 1 is called a **binary digit** or **bit** for short. Each set of binary digits is interpreted by the CPU into a command to do a very specific job, such as compare these two numbers, or put this number in that memory location.

**Assembly language** : Instead of machine language that so hard for humans to read and understand, This was invented language that each instruction is identified by a short abbreviation and names and other numbers can be used.

**Assembler** is program that translate the assembly program into machine language before it can be executed by computer.

**Compiler** is program that reads source code and produces a stand-alone executable program that can then be run.

**Interpreter** is a program that directly executes the instructions in the source code without requiring them to be compiled into an executable first.

**Query** is a request for data or information from a datavase table or combination of table. 

**capability** : An operating system security or access control model where specific types of access to a specific object are granted by giving a process this data structure or token.

**Memory footprint** : refers to the amount of main memory that a program uses or references while running

**NUll-terminated string** : a null-terminated string is a character string stored as an array containing the characters and terminated with a null character (a character with a value of zero).

**String Constants** : String constants , alse known as string literals, are a special type of constants which store fixed wequences of charactors. A string literal is a sequence of any number of characters surrounded by double quotes.

**Blob** : a binary large object, a collection of binary data stored as a single entity. Blobs are typically image, audio, or other multimedia objects, though sometimes binary executable code is stored as a blob.

**Overhead** : any combination of excess or indirect computation time, memory, bandwidth, or other resources that are required to perform a specific task. ; 어떤 처리를 하기 위해 들어가는 간접적인 처리시간. 메모리 등을 말한다. 예를 들어 a 라는 처리를 단순하기 실행하는데 10초가 걸린다고 가정할 때  안정성 고려와 B 라는 부가적 처리를 추가 했을 때 15초 걸렸다면 오버헤드는 5초가 된다. 

**Strict subset** : A is a subset of B, but additionally, A is different from B.

**Dummy vertex** :  represented by small circles with grey fills.

**Degenerate** : lacking some property, order, distinctness of structure previously or usually present.

**Attribute** : a chaneable property or characteristic of some component of a program that can be set to different values.

**Invocation** : Each execution of a shader within a Rendering Command

**Validation : checking or verifying any data before it is allowed into a computer system. this process (data validation) helps ensure data was not compromied or corrupted during transmission

textured surface : 

**Refresh Rate** :   the number of times per second that a rster-based display device displays a new image (화면 주사율, 화면 빈도율, 화면 재생률)

**Raster graphics** represents a two-dimensional picture as a rectangular matrx or grid of square pixels.

**Bandwidth** : a measurement of the ability of an electronic communications device or system (such as a computer network) to send and receive information

low frequency : 저주파, 30 ~ 300 kilohertZ

**Coprocessor** : an extra processor in a computer that is designed to perform specialized tasks (such as mathematical calculations)

**Operation** : an action that is carried out to accomplish.

**Fixed statement** : The Fixed statement prevents the garbage collector from relocating a moveable variable and declares a pointer to that variable. The address of a fixed, or pinned, variable doesn't change during execution of the statement.

**Atomic** : Generally, you can summarize atomic as "one at a time". For example, when accessing or mutating a property is atomic, it means that only one read or write operation can be performed at a time. if you have a program that reads a property atomically, this means that the property cannot change during this read operation.

**Gouraud shading** : (computer graphics) A method of sumulating the effects of light colour across the surface of an object, based on estimates of the surface normal of each vertex in a polygonal 3D model.  / 고러드 채식 , 3차원 그래픽에서 화면에 나타난 입체 표면에 색을 적당하게 입혀서 물체에 입체감과 질감을 주는 채색 알고리즘의 하나. 이것은 두 평면이 만나는 곳에서 색이 갑자기 변하는 것을 막기 위해 평면 중심에서 교차선까지 연속적으로 색이 점차로 변하게 된다. 

**Frustum** : 기하학에서 절두체는 입체(보통 원뿔이나 각뿔)를 절단하는 하나 혹은  두 평행면 사이의 부분이다. 컴퓨터 그래픽스에서 viewing frustum 은 스크린에서 볼 수 있는 삼차원 영역인다.

**Snap** : snapping allows an object to be easily positioned in alignment with grid lines, guide lines or another object, by causing it to automatically jump to an exact position when the user drags it to the proximity of the desired locaion.

**Element-wise** : 두 벡터와 행렬에서 같은 위치에 있는 원소끼리 덧셈과 뺄셈을 하는 것.

**Unit vector** : 단위 벡터, 길이가 1인 벡터

**dithering** : 간단히 점과 점을 일정 패턴으로 교차해서 찍으면서 멀리서 보면 색이 섞여 보이게끔 하는 기법이다. 원리 면으로 점묘법과 비슷하다. 컴퓨터에서 반투명 기법이 지원되지 않았을 때도 많이 썼다. 두 가지 색을 1픽셀씩 번갈아가며 찍은 뒤에, 색 한 가지를 프로그램에서 출력되지 않는 것으로 처리하면 반투명 꼼수가 완성된다. 색 표현수가 많아진 현재도 쓰이는 기법이다. 계단 현상을 제거하는 안티에일리어싱도 디더링 기법의 일종이고 사양을 덜 잡아먹기때문에 저사양 컴퓨터에서 그래픽적인 꼼수로 끄는 경우도 있다. 

**quantization** : 양자화, 연속적으로 보이는 양을 자연수로 셀 수 있는 양으로 재해석하는 것을 말한다.

**Screen door effect** : The screen door effect(SDE) is a visual artifact of displays, where the fine lines separating pixel (or subpixel) become visible in the displayed image. This can be seen in digital projector image and regulars under magnification or at close range, but the increases in display resolution have made this much less significant. More recently, the screen door effect has been an issue with virtual reality headsets and other head-mounted displays, because these are viewed at a much closer distance, and stretch a single display across a much wider filed of view.

**Swizzling** : in computer, swizzling is the ability to compose vectors by arbitratily rearranging and combining compnents of other vectors. for example, if A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, where the compoenents are x, y, z, w, respectively, you could compute B = A.wwxy, whereupon B would equal {4, 4, 1, 2} . Additionally, combining two two- component vectors can create a four-component vector, or any combination of vectors and swizzlnig. This is common in GPGPU application.

**shadow acne** :

identity matrix : In linear algebra, the identity matrix of size n is the nxn square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere,

alignment : 그래픽 요소가 정렬하느 가상의 선의 방향에 대해 기술하는 것

aspect ratio : 영상의 가로 세로의 비

swizzling : in computer graphics, swizzling is the ability to compose vectors by arbitrarily rearranging and combining components of other vectors. 
- HLSL 의 swizzling 은 HLSL 코드를 간결하게 만드는데 큰 역할을 하는 독특한 표기법으로, 벡터 배정문에서 성분들의 순서를 임의로 지정할 수 있게 하는 것이다. 

Assignment statement : Assignment(배정) 연산은 변수의 내용을 변경하는 윈시적인 연산이다.
