unreal project Games -> Blank (Path : Unreal\\Part1, name HelloUnreal)

- Open visual studio

- Override Init Func
```c++
// MyGameInstance.h
class HELLOUNREAL_API UMyGameInstance : public UGameInstance
{
	GENERATED_BODY()
	
public:
	virtual void Init() override;
};
```

\*** In Unreal Engine, parent class expressed to 'Super'.

In the case of a class that inherits a class from Unreal Engine, if the class overrides the function of the parent class, the function of the parent class provided by Unreal Engine must be executed first.

\*** How to Compile Unreal Code
if it happened that changing in header file, End Unreal Editor and Compiler with Visual Studio. if Changing happened only Source file, Compile with Live Coding (Ctrl + Alt + F11).
when Unreal Editor is open, you should processing only with Live Coding.

\*** How to  create new C++ Class
Tools -> New C++ Class -> Select Class to Use
