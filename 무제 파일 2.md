Motion Matching Node:

This node is the primary AnimGraph node that drives pose selection in a Motion Matching system.

The Motion Matching node requires two key components:

1. A Pose Search Database, which contains the animation data the node will use to make selections. Additionally, Pose Search Database assets use a Pose Search Schema asset which defines what pose and trajectory data is used to make the selection.

2. A Pose History node, which contains the pose and Character Trajectory data that will be used to query and match animation data against.

In this example setup, the Pose Search Database asset is set in the Update Motion Matching Function, which can be viewed in the node’s Details panel in the On Update property.

In addition to the required inputs, the node has some additional notable features.

On the Motion Matching node you can use the Blend Time float input to dynamically change the blend time. This can be helpful when different kinds of animations need to blend at different speeds. In this example setup, the Blend Time input is set using the Get_MMBlendTime function.

The Motion Matching node also has two AnimNode Functions that are applied to the node:

1. On Update which calls the Update_MotionMatching function.

2. On Motion Matching State Update which calls the Update_MotionMatching_PostSelection function.

The Update_MotionMatching function is evaluating a Chooser asset and outputs an array of Motion Matching Databases. This allows us to separate our locomotion data into multiple databases and allows the Chooser to filter the pool of animation data the Motion Matching node can search in any given frame, to only relevant animations. This implementation can increase both your control over the final selection and reduce your project’s performance cost.

The Update_MotionMatching_PostSelection function allows us to perform additional logic based on the result of the Motion Matching selection. In this case, we cache the database the selected animation is in so that we can grab any tags it has, which can be used for future selection logic. The tags are grabbed in the event graph (due to a thread safety issue). See "CurrentDatabaseTags".

You can also double-click the Motion Matching Node to open up it's Blend Stack Graph, which is an internal graph applied to each animation where we're handling Orientation Warping and Steering.
